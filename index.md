## Biography
Birdperson first appears in [[Ricksy Business]], where he attends Rick's party and hooks up with Summer's friend, Tammy. He is also one of the very few party-goers who remains behind to help clean up, although he may have just been waiting for Tammy to be ready to leave.

When Morty shows his frustration at the party's mess as it would mean no more adventures with Rick if his parents see the house in this state, Birdperson informs Morty that "Wubba lubba dub dub" means "I am in great pain, please help me" in his native language. Morty is skeptical that Rick actually means this, though this knowledge spurs him to eventually press Rick into action to preserve their ability to go on adventures together.

Birdperson later reappears, along with Tammy, in the episode [[Get Schwifty]], where he saves Morty's life after the latter jumped through numerous, hostile dimensions before collapsing from exhaustion. He explains to Morty that leaving Rick was a "dick move", and that Rick really does care about him. Furthermore, if it wasn't for Rick, he [Birdperson] would be dead and would never have met Morty. He then recharges the [[Portal gun]] and sends Morty back to Rick.

In "[[The Wedding Squanchers]]", he and Tammy get married and have a huge wedding party. During this time, he confessed to [[Beth Smith|Beth]] that he and Rick are wanted by the [[Galactic Federation]] for committing "crimes in the name of freedom" which Beth shrugs off. Shortly after, during the reception, Tammy reveals herself to be a member of the Galactic Federation secret service and shoots Birdperson multiple times, followed by a shootout with the rest of the criminals in the room.

Birdperson makes a cameo appearance in "[[The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy]]", in the form of a small statue that can be seen in the background.

Until her identity was revealed to be false, Birdperson was a devoted love interest to Tammy. He was calm and conservative while she had no filter in the things she said, no matter how inappropriate. It was revealed in the commentary for [[Get Schwifty]] that the creators were displeased with how the way things ended, finding humor in their brief relationship. [[Dan Harmon|Harmon]] and [[Ryan Ridley|Ridley]] in particular considered recreating that formula in some way, admiring the dynamic between Tammy and Birdperson.

In the ending credits for [[The Rickshank Rickdemption]], Tammy and the [[Gromflomites]] resurrected Birdperson as a cyborg and renamed him Phoenixperson. Although Tammy wanted his name to be Cyberbird, she didn't push hard enough to make that official. She settled on Phoenixperson and took off with him.

## Personality
Birdperson is very wise, having experienced so much about the universe with his best friend, [[Rick Sanchez|Rick]]. He offers well-meaning advice to anyone willing to listen to him, like [[Morty Smith|Morty]].
